        <h1 className="about-intro"><strong>Matthew Gerard Thorry</strong>: Just your average teacher-turned-techie</h1>
        <p className="about-item">Matt comes from <strong>humble beginnings</strong> in the countryside of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Township,_New_Jersey" target="_blank">Warren County, New Jersey <i class="fa fa-external-link"/></a>. <strong>After studying earth science and education</strong>, Matt became a teacher in New York City. He spent <strong>seven years teaching science</strong> to students in grades 8 - 12. Students generally agreed that his class was <strong>'lit'.</strong> Unfortunately, Matt was so <strong>dedicated</strong> to his career, doing everything from team leader to Regents Coordinator, that he ran out of opportunities -- <strong>so he began to look elsewhere</strong> and started coding. </p>
        <p className="about-item">As a <strong>full stack engineer</strong>, Matt has demonstrated his ability to <strong>crush it</strong> on both the front end and back end. He is fluent in <strong>Ruby and JavaScript</strong> (currently learning Python). He is also quite competent with many <strong>modern frameworks</strong> such as React, Redux and Rails. <strong>Thankfully,</strong> Matt was able to become a full stack engineer and will <strong>never</strong> have to worry about running out of opportunities again!</p>
        <p className="about-item">Matt is <strong>passionate</strong> about technology, science, our planet, travel and making people laugh.</p>
